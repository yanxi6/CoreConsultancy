                    <h1>Why Every Design Firm Needs an FBI Special Agent</h1>
                    <p>By: <span class="name"> Christopher Whitcomb</span></p>
                    <p>
                        According to Paul Moskal, Director of CORE Consultancy,
                        there is no typical day in the FBI. Throughout his
                        30-year career with the bureau, he worked on matters
                        ranging from bank robberies and cyber terrorism to
                        issues of foreign counterintelligence —“spy stuff” in
                        the truest sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He worked long-term undercover assignments as a
                        marathoner (he was an avid runner), a hedge fund
                        operator, and an organized crime lawyer allegedly using
                        drug money to pay bribes and develop luxury hotels and
                        golf courses. He supervised kidnapping and extortion
                        squads, worked in the National Press Office, and tracked
                        down spies from foreign governments. He traveled the
                        world, working stints in London, Rome, Port-au-Prince
                        and Toronto, among other cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul’s interest in the FBI stretches back to his
                        childhood. For as long as he can remember, he had big
                        plans to become the next Sherlock Holmes — solving
                        mysteries and fighting crime, pipe in hand. This fantasy
                        followed him into college where he earned degrees in
                        political science and English, and eventually a
                        doctorate of law. “I remember reading, at the time, that
                        more than 400 members of Congress were attorneys,” said
                        Paul. “That statistic made an impression on me, and I
                        remember thinking that if I wanted to help people, law
                        school seemed like a great place to start.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three months after college, Paul joined the FBI,
                        pledging to commit his career to protecting the public
                        and upholding the Constitution of the United States. He
                        started as a special agent and worked his way up to
                        Chief Division Counsel — leading younger agents,
                        directing investigative programs, and overseeing every
                        significant case that walked through the doors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2014, Paul made the transition into the private
                        sector, assuming the role of director of compliance at
                        CannonDesign — which, at the time, was a fairly
                        non-existent role within the industry. “Compliance, as
                        reviewed and dictated by the government, has more
                        traditionally been applied to industries like
                        manufacturing, banking and pharmaceuticals,” said Paul.
                        “But things have changed, and the government’s role in
                        contracting standards within the A/E industry has grown.
                        Federal investigative agencies are increasingly
                        reviewing the conduct of A/E firms to ensure they are
                        practicing within the law.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul’s day-to-day job is similar to the Chief Division
                        Counsel role at the FBI — making sure everyone in the
                        organization, regardless of job duty, understands the
                        law and the firm’s policies and procedures, and adheres
                        to them to further the firm’s mission. Under Paul’s
                        guidance, CannonDesign has launched a robust Code of
                        Conduct, established an ethics and integrity hotline,
                        and put its employees through more than 15,850 hours of
                        compliance training. Based on results from a recent
                        employee engagement survey, questions related to
                        employees’ understanding of CannonDesign’s compliance
                        protocols received the highest scores of any in the
                        150-question survey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond promoting a culture of integrity within
                        CannonDesign, Paul has committed himself to furthering
                        compliance adoption throughout the profession. “Since
                        launching our program, I’ve met with more than 24 A/E
                        firms to share our knowledge and help kick-start their
                        efforts. This is new territory for most firms, but
                        they’re realizing that the risks in today’s business
                        climate are just too great. The public, our clients and
                        the government all expect A/E firms to have robust
                        compliance programs in place.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Paul’s life has slowed down a bit since his
                        days in the FBI, his pledge to protecting the public is
                        unwavering. Now, rather than spend his days under cover,
                        Paul is proud to be leading the discussion about
                        compliance in the AEC industry. He recognizes that
                        bringing the topic out into the open is the best way to
                        safeguard design firms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There really shouldn’t be any hesitancy to talking
                        about compliance in our industry” adds Paul. “Through
                        discussion, education and training – that’s how you
                        build understanding and ensure AEC firms around the
                        country are best prepared to conduct business in this
                        new era.”
